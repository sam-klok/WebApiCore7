Again, I'm playing with Web API and Entity Framework.
A lot of it changed for a past few years, so I need to try it under .Net 7

From design point of view, for now, I will follow tutorial and create "code first" approach.
Later I will create or modify this project to follow more real-life scenario of "database-first" design.

Thank you
